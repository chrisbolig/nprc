Numpy ray casting for triangles, need to pass in triangles with shape (number_of_triangles,3,3)

## Description

Comes with two jsons that contain triangles for two 3D jets. Pass in the rays direction, origin (defaults to 0,0,0), and then cast into the triangles.
Was coded from three stackoverflow raycasting discussions.
Thanks for checking it out!
